My name is Clayton Moore and I’m 29 years old currently living in Atlanta, Georgia, which I’ve
resided for almost 3 years. I attended high school in Southern California with a very diverse
group of students, which I truly enjoyed and learned the importance of differences. After
completing highschool, I attended Hampton University in Virginia from ’09-’13, initially as an
Engineering major, ultimately changing my major to Business Management. As a student, it was
important for me to learn the importance of managing and developing others.
Programming was first introduced to me through a family member, who thought is would be a great
fit, given my analytical abilities and aspiration to solve problems. As a result, I began self-teaching code 
and got tremendously interested in tech and it’s complexities from a programming and coding. To further my knowledge in tech, I attended a meetup called, Code for ATL where I met with an awesome group of engineers. They were advanced
engineers who were eager to offer tips to develop my skills and encourage my path to coding.
The support and patience was impeccable. My determination to learn programming began to flourish
spending countless hours studying frontend and backend languages.
I’ve always had a niche for problem solving and constantly wonder how certain objects function.
I realized that programming kept my brain moving at a stimulating rate. It’s almost similar to how a gamer would feel
getting a new game, and wanting to complete each level.
After completing Flatiron bootcamp, I plan to utilize my skills in a startup environment or tech
firm to help grow and scale their business. In the meantime, working in other industries has
helped me realize that there aren’t any short-cuts to getting a job done and that I was determined to give
programming my full attention and 100% effort.
